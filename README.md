# DynamicGrid
Mendix wrapper for react-data-grid. The grid takes both the data and column metadata in JSON format as input, allowing user to dynamically build the grid definition. The data input as JSON can be useful when working with non-Mendix storage. The widget makes it easy to implement dynamic sorting and also allows for cell edition and row selection.

## Features
- dynamic column definition in JSON format
- data provided in JSON format
- cell editing
